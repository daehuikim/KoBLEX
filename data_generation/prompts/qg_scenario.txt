You are given a legal question-answer pair based on statutory interpretation. Rewrite this QA pair into a realistic legal scenario involving fictional characters (e.g., 갑, 을) where the same legal logic would apply.

Do the following:
1. Create a short but concrete fact pattern (case scenario) that would require applying the same legal reasoning.
2. Rewrite the original question to match the scenario.
3. Keep the original legal answer, with minor edits if needed to match the scenario.

Output Format:
background_fact: {BACKGROUND FACT}
question: {MULTI-HOP LEGAL QUESTION}
answer: {ANSWER}
