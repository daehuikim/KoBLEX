You are given a legal question scenario, its proposed answer, and a set of legal context provisions.

Your task is to evaluate the following:

1. Scenario Consistent: Determine whether the background_scenario + question_scenario could have been composed using only the explicit legal content given in context. In other words, assess whether the question is logically and legally consistent with the context without requiring outside legal knowledge.

2. Correct: Evaluate whether the proposed answer is legally correct based on the background_scenario, question_scenario, and the context.

3. Derivable: Assess whether the proposed answer can be logically and completely derived from the provided context alone, without requiring any unstated assumptions.

Use Korean for the justifications.
